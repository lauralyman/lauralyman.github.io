These instructions refer to the specific video on Moodle: [Portfolio Part 3: Pushing to Github from RStudio](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=1096465). Please note that this document *does not replace* the video instructions.

Make sure all commands are run in the `Terminal` (on the bottom of RStudio), which is the tab next to `Console` and `Background Jobs`.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# (1) Note: At Time 00:19 in Video:

-   Ignore all the files I have on the bottom right
-   Your code space will just have `.gitignore`, your `Rproj` file, and `README.md`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# (2) Command At Time 00:28 in Video (Optional)

``` markdown
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

-   This command lists (using `ls`) all keys currently existing in a (hidden) file called `~/.ssh`
-   Even if you have a key here, you probably should generate a new one, so running this command isn't strictly necessary; you can proceed with the video.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
# (3) Command At Time 01:01 in Video:

``` markdown
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

-   **Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your MHC email address.**
-   This command generates a personal key for you.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
# (4) Command At Time 02:00 in Video:

``` markdown
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
# (5) Command At Time 02:20 in Video:

``` markdown
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
# (6) Command At Time 02:33 in Video:

``` markdown
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

-   The command `cat` prints the content of a file in the terminal (which we will then copy)

-   When copying your key from the terminal (after using `cat` to output it), don't add any newlines or white space.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
# (7) Command At Time 04:12 in Video:

``` markdown
git remote -v
```

**If this command generates an error with the words `git` and `fatal`**, rest assured -- this simply means you are not entering the commands in the directory (folder) where your Github documents are located.

-   To fix this, go to the `Files` explorer and find the folder with your `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `Rproj` file (mine is called `test_website.Rproj`):

-   ![](Fig1.png){width="397"}

-   Click on the blue Gear icon and select `Copy Folder Path to Clipboard`. This will copy the exact location of your folder.

-   ![](Fig2.png){width="396"}

-   In `Terminal`, type `cd` (which is `cd` followed by a space) and then paste in your folder location from your clipboard. For example, I would have: `cd ~/R/STAT244/test_website`

-   In general, the command `cd` in `Terminal` means "go to this location" (for Linux systems).

-   Now you should try:

    ``` markdown
    git remote -v
    ```

    and you should see something akin to what is in the video:

    ``` markdown
    origin https://github.com/lauralyman/lauralyman.github.io.git (fetch)
    origin https://github.com/lauralyman/lauralyman.github.io.git (pull)
    ```

# (8) Full Command At Time 05:33 in Video:

The video makes this hard to see, but the entire command is:

``` markdown
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPOSITORY.git
```

where you replace `OWNER` with your Github username (mine is `lauralyman`) and `REPOSITORY` with the name of your online repository (which should end in `github.io`; mine is `lauralyman.github.io`). So the command I enter is:

``` markdown
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:lauralyman/lauralyman.github.io.git
```
