# Instructions

To complete your assignment, please follow these steps.

1. Download this Rmd file from Moodle and save it on your computer in a place that you can easily find again. 

2. Add your name and the due date to the YAML header at the start of this file. 
3. Open this Rmd file in RStudio. Make sure you've installed all necessary R packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `readr`, `ggplot2`). You can test this by running the first code chunk below. (If successful, no messages/errors should appear when running it.)

4. Ensure any data files (i.e., CSV or  Excel files included with the HW on Moodle) are saved in the *same location as this Rmd file.* 

# Packages & Document Set-Up

library(readxl)  # Read excel files
library(readr)   # Read CSV files
library(dplyr)   # Use functions like summarize
library(ggplot2) # Make plots
library(mosaic)  # Convenient interface to t.test function
library(gmodels) # Use fit.contrast() function
library(Sleuth3) # Use data from the textbook

# Print 10 significant digits in summarize output

# Question 1

The National Highway System Designation Act was signed into law in the United States on November 28, 1995. Among other things, the act abolished the federal mandate of 55-mile-per-hour maximum speed limits on roads in the United States and permitted states to establish their own limits. Of the 50 states (plus the District of Columbia), 32 increased their speed limits either at the beginning of 1996 or sometime during 1996 (variable `SpeedLimit` equals `Inc`). Shown below are the percentage changes (variable `PctChange`) in interstate highway traffic fatalities from 1995 to 1996. 

```{r}
Traffic <- ex0223 
head(Traffic,4)
```

Data from “Report to Congress: The Effect of Increased Speed Limits in the Post-NMSL Era,” National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, February, 1998; available in the reports library at \href{http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/}{\textcolor{blue}{\underline{http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/}}}.

### (a) Create side-by-side histograms of `PctChange` in the states stratified by whether the speed limit was increased or retained using `facet_wrap()`. Add \underline{informative axis labels}; that is, do NOT just keep the default labels. 

### HINT. For an example, look at the code for the side-by-side histograms under the Exploratory Analysis section of [\underline{\textcolor{blue}{Lab 3}}](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=1068020). Alternatively, look at the code in Q2 of your HW 1. 

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

### (b) Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to output a table with the sample mean and standard deviation of `PctChange` for each of the "treatment" groups (that is, the states that increased the speed limit and the states that retained it). 

### HINT. To see an example, look at the first code chunk under the Exploratory Analysis section of [\underline{\textcolor{blue}{Lab 3}}](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=1068020). Alternatively, look at the last code chunk of `0.Useful_functions.pdf` under the [\underline{\textcolor{blue}{R/RStudio Review Session}}](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=1067976) materials.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

### (c) Before performing a two sample $t$-test, it is important to assess whether the assumptions of this model seem appropriate for the data set under consideration. Based on your answers to (a) and (b), along with the information you have about the data context, briefly address whether you believe each of the following assumptions seem reasonable:
* For each group of `SpeedLimit`, either the number of observations is at least 30 \underline{or} the observations appear (roughly) normally distributed.
* For each group of `SpeedLimit`, the observations are drawn from a population with the \underline{same variance} (that is, the sample standard deviations or spreads of each group seem similar).
* The observations within each group of `SpeedLimit` are independent. 
* The observations across the groups of `SpeedLimit` are independent. 

**\underline{Note}. It is okay if not all of the assumptions seem perfectly satisfied; they rarely are in real life! It is also okay if you believe the data context does not give you enough information to assess some of these points. What matters is that: (a) we are being honest and mindful about potential simplifying assumptions, and (b) we recognize the type of information as researchers might need to seek out.**

### (d) Write the relevant hypothesis test for assessing whether increasing the speed limit affects the percent change in traffic fatalities for a state. Express your hypotheses both \underline{symbolically} and in \underline{words}. Be sure to \underline{define} any parameters you are using in your hypothesis test.
 
$H_0$: 

$H_A$: 

### (e) The following code splits `Traffic` into to separate data frames: one with the states that increased their speed limits (`Traffic_Increased`) and another with states that retained their speed limits (`Traffic_Retained`). You do not need to modify this code.

```{r}
Traffic_Increased <- Traffic %>% filter(SpeedLimit == "Inc")
Traffic_Retained <- Traffic %>% filter(SpeedLimit == "Ret")
```

### Use `t.test()` and the data frames above to compute the observed $t$-statistic and $p$-value for your hypothesis test. Remember to set `var.equal = TRUE`! Also interpret the \underline{results} of the hypothesis test in context (i.e., what we conclude based on the $p$-value, not the interpretation of the $p$-value itself). Be sure to specify what significance threshold $\alpha$ you are using in your conclusion.

# Question 2

Overall mortality indicators (e.g., life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. They are also one of the most frequently used indicators for comparing socioeconomic development across countries.

The data in this problem is from the United Nations Population Division and contain the following variables for 208 countries: 

* `LifeExpectancy_2022`: the life expectancy at birth in the year 2022 (number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life);

* `IncomeGroup`: the country's income group, coded as: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high.

**Data source and description**: \href{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN}{\textcolor{blue}{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN}}

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Use the read_excel() function to import "LifeExpectancy.xlsx"
# Name the variable/data frame LifeExpectancy
# YOUR CODE HERE

# View the first 6 rows of the data frame
head(LifeExpectancy)
```

### (a) Make side by side box plots of the data.

```{r, fig.align='left', out.width='70%'}
# CODE FOR YOUR FIGURE HERE
```

### (b) Does the data provide evidence that there is a difference in the mean life expectancy for countries from lower-middle and upper-middle income groups? Conduct a relevant hypothesis test, clearly stating your hypotheses in terms of \underline{equations} involving some of the group means and \underline{written sentences} explaining what each hypothesis means in context. Also \underline{interpret the results of your hypothesis test in context}.

### (c) Does the data provide evidence that there is a difference in the mean life expectancy for low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries (\underline{combined as one group}) versus the mean life expectancy for high income countries? Conduct a relevant hypothesis test, clearly stating your hypotheses in terms of \underline{equations} involving some of the group means and \underline{written sentences} explaining what each hypothesis means in context. Also \underline{interpret the results of your hypothesis test in context}.
