Save these in the same folder/directory.\nOpen the Quarto file in RStudio: File &gt; Open File... &gt;. If you’re working on the MHC RStudio server, you need to upload the files first: go to the Files panel, then click Upload. Upload the .qmd file and any data files. You will need to upload each file one at a time.\nUpdate the author and date in the YAML header of this file.\nClick the Render button. If successful, you should have a new window pop up with a nice looking HTML document.\nFor this lab, you may need to still the package glmnet.\n\nAsk for help if you encounter issues on any of the steps above. Once you’ve successfully made it through these steps, you can continue."
